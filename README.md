# :video_game: Safe Between the Cogs

Safe Between the Cogs is a 2D video game developed in Unity3D 5.6.  There is currently only a single level but more to come.  ALL graphics and code were developed by me.  If you would like to collabrate in anyway, let me know.

Working example can be found on [facebook](https://apps.facebook.com/1893696650851210).

### Things still left to do:

* Create leaderboard
* Create more levels
* Need a better looking UI
* Need to use better audio clips
* Facebook sharing
